/* ---- webfonts -----------------------------------------------------------

   These used to come from fonts.googleapis.com on every page. Two problems
   with that, and the second is the serious one.

   Every visitor's IP reached Google on every page load, for a site whose
   subject is not handing your business to third parties.

   And the Entropy Workshop's site build carried the same three tags. Opened
   from file:// -- which is exactly what someone does after downloading it --
   it announced "this copy is running offline", in green, while three requests
   went to Google. The page stated something false at the moment a reader was
   deciding whether to trust it.

   The same two files were already vendored for the offline build, which
   inlines them as data: URIs. They are copied out here so the site can serve
   them from its own origin, which keeps one source of truth for the bytes.

   Note what is NOT in them: the check mark, the half-filled circle and the
   four card suits. Neither Jost nor Open Sans contains those glyphs at all --
   verified against the upstream variable fonts, not just the subsets -- so
   they have always been drawn by a system fallback face, under Google Fonts
   exactly as here. Adding them to the subset is not possible and not needed. */
/* The licence files travel with the fonts. The OFL permits bundling only if

   is a copy: the browser fetches these two files from our origin, so the

   repository the reader never sees. The offline build solves the same problem
   differently, by inlining the text -- see build/tools/entropy-page.mjs. */

   This is a correctness requirement, not a style choice. entropy-core.js is

   CRLF lines and 2356 LF ones. Git normalised the committed blob, which meant
   the SHA-256 published beside the file described the working copy rather than
   the bytes GitHub served. Anyone following the verify instructions in
   SECURITY.md would have got a mismatch and been right to distrust the file.

   It also made the build platform-dependent: identical source, different
   checksum, depending on which operating system ran it.

   The artifact is committed with -text in .gitattributes so git stores these
