/* Build guard: nothing in docs/ may fetch from somewhere it should not.

   This exists because of a bug that survived a long time and was invisible to
   every test we had. The Entropy Workshop's site build carried the same three
   Google Fonts tags as the rest of the site. Opened from file:// -- the thing
   a reader does after downloading it -- it printed "this copy is running
   offline", in green, while three requests went to Google. Nothing failed. The
   page simply said something untrue at the moment someone was deciding whether
   to trust it.

   So the rule is enforced at build time, and it is two different rules:

     offline build   no automatic request at all, not even a relative one.
                     Everything it needs is inline or a data: URI.

     everything else relative requests are fine and necessary. An automatic
                     request to another origin is not, unless it is listed in
                     ALLOWED below with a reason.

   What it does NOT flag matters as much. A click-through <a href> to a
   specification, a canonical link, an og:image URL in metadata -- none of
   those fetch anything on load, and the offline file is full of the first
   kind on purpose. Banning the string "https://" would be easy, wrong, and
   would train people to work around the guard. So this looks at the surfaces
   that actually cause a fetch. */

import { readFileSync, readdirSync, statSync, existsSync } from 'node:fs';
import { join, relative, dirname } from 'node:path';

/* Automatic requests we accept from a page's own markup, and why. Anything
   not listed is a failure. */
const ALLOWED = {
  /* Both pages preconnect in their own <head>, ahead of the calls the shared
     script makes below. */
  'dashboard.html': ['https://mempool.space'],
  'block-demo.html': ['https://mempool.space']
};

/* Origins the shared site script may reach.

   Kept separate from ALLOWED because assets/js/site-refresh.js is loaded by
   every page and decides what to call at runtime from what it finds in the
   DOM -- the glossary fetch only runs where there is a glossary, the price
   calls only where there is a dashboard. Attributing them page by page from
   the source would be guesswork, so they are declared once, here, as the set
   the shared script is permitted to reach at all.

   Every one is a public read-only endpoint called with no key and no
   identifier attached.

   The Workshop is not an exception that needs listing: it loads the same
   script, and its CSP says connect-src 'none', so none of these can fire
   there whatever the script contains. */
/* Which local script may name which external origin, and why.

   Permission belongs to a file, not to an origin in the abstract. A single
   allowlist applied to every asset meant a stylesheet could carry
   background-image: url("https://api.kraken.com/pixel") and pass, because an
   API was permitted somewhere else entirely -- a real automatic request, waved
   through. Any file not listed here may name no external origin at all.

   The rule for a script is deliberately blunter than for markup: every origin
   it names must be declared, whether or not the guard can see a call. Real
   code builds URLs in variables and wraps its own fetch helper, and matching
   only literals inside fetch() missed every one of the dashboard's. The cost
   is that a URL in a comment also has to be written down, which is a line of
   documentation rather than a defect.

   Every endpoint below is a public read-only one, called with no key and no
   identifier attached. */
/* Origins named inside a page's own inline scripts. Same rule as
   SCRIPT_ORIGINS above and the same reason for existing: naming an origin is
   not fetching one, but the difference has to be declared rather than assumed.

   The Workshop inlines Project Nayuki's QR generator, whose MIT notice carries
   the project's URL. The licence requires that notice be kept, so the string
   cannot simply be deleted -- and it sits in a comment, which no browser
